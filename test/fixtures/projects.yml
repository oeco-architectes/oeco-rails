  title: Ohio Law Allows Breaking Into Cars to Save Animals
  content: |
    Let’s hear it for Ohio. A bill that allows people to break into vehicles to
    save animals as well as children has been signed into law by Gov. Another
    law set to go into effect in August protects first responders who provide
    medical aid to animals during emergencies, according to cleveland.com. The
    first law is aimed at reducing heatstroke-related deaths among children and
    animals by allowing good Samaritans to act as long as they call 911 and
    first check to determine if the car door is locked before breaking a window.

    On a 78-degree day, the temperature inside of a parked car can reach 100 or
    more degrees in minutes.

    Ohio will also officially permit EMTs and firefighters to provide medical
    aid to dogs and cats when responding to emergencies. The goal is to shield
    first responders from all liability for rendering aid. That includes giving
    mouth-to-snout ventilation, administering oxygen, controlling bleeding,
    bandaging wounds and stabilizing fractures.

    It’s a paradise for cat lovers. And Japan’s unique and delightful cat island
    is experiencing a tourist boom, according to a report in qz.com. Friendly
    cats roam free on the small island off the coast of Miyagi where felines out
    number humans. The island of Toshirojima is home to more than 100 cats
    versus 82 people, down from 191 in 1990. Many are elderly pensioners.

    Nearly 40,000 people visited Cat Island in 2015 compared to just 6,262 the
    year before, government spokesman Hiromichi Suzuki told Quartz. The main
    draw is the cats, but residents have created cat-shaped homes. And a
    cat-themed NGO is working to help the island recover from the tsunami and
    earthquake disaster.

    The tourist boom is due to the popularity of “Cat Island” videos that
    appeared in 2014 on YouTube, the article notes. The videos show friendly
    cats swarming tourists who arrive with food. The cats have the run of the
    three-square-kilometer island where fishing was the primary source of
    livelihood.

    The Quartz article includes some interesting history: “Fisherman living on
    Tashirojima first brought to the cats to feed on the mice that were
    destroying silkworms necessary to make fishing lines. The relationship
    worked out so well that the locals even built a shrine to honor of one cat
    that died in the line of duty.”

    Japan has thousands of cat lovers, but many live in small apartments where
    pets are forbidden, all of which increases the allure of the island, which
    is rising to the status of a national treasure.

  title: Photo of Cat and His Stuff Dumped on Street Sets Off Chain Reaction

    The photo was heart breaking: a forlorn, frightened cat crying sitting
    curbside on a Brooklyn street. Next to him are a discarded pillow and litter
    box that were thrown out along with the abandoned kitty. “He reportedly sat
    there crying for two hours, before he was scared away by a street sweeper,”
    according to the posting. The photo was published last week on Facebook, and
    shared by several thousand people, setting off a chain reaction of outrage
    at the person responsible and sympathy for the cat. “I’m so angry I can’t
    think straight,” said one poster. “Makes me want to cry,” said another.
    “Terrible what was done to this poor kitty.”

    The cat was abandoned on Nostrand Avenue between Lefferts and Sterling. And
    it wasn’t long before the hunt was on. New York City animal angels sprang
    into action. Michael Dietrich of HOPE Staten Island Animal Rescue went to
    Brooklyn to look for the cat. And a small army of caring neighbors and
    members of Flatbush Area Team For Cats, known as FAT Cats looked high and
    low. But still no kitty. “We got reported sightings but were never able to
    act fast enough. Then this AM, the call came in from a local TNR advocate
    and cat rescuer in retirement, Karen Oh, [who] found him in her backyard.”
    Everyone involved was thrilled.

    “Here at Flatbush Area Team for Cats, we are ecstatic to give a happy update
    to last week’s story of Nostrand, the cat abandoned on Nostrand Ave. We
    immediately rushed over to find, that yes indeed, it was him!”

    “We immediately brought him to get vetted, and screened for a microchip. No
    microchip, but we are happy to say he is a healthy one-year-old male,
    FeLV/FIV negative, who was treated for fleas.” Hundreds of worried and upset
    people who had seen the photo of Nostrand, including this writer for
    LifeWithCats, were incredibly relieved to hear he had been located and was
    in good hands. “Thank you! I could not rest,” said one poster. Here’s a
    photo of Nostrand finally getting the love and comfort he deserves.

    FAT Cats shared the good news and is requesting donations. “Please help us
    with his vet bill, even a small amount is greatly appreciated. “Thank you to
    everyone for your prayers, good thoughts, and efforts to find Nostrand. We
    will be contacting people that offered to foster/adopt him. If you are
    interested in him or any of our other adult cats please contact us at
    brooklynfatcats@gmail.com.”
